        {
          question: 'How long does a typical roof last?',
          answer: 'The lifespan of your roof depends on the material used. Asphalt shingles typically last 20-30 years, architectural shingles 25-35 years, metal roofing 40-70 years, and tile or slate roofing can last 50-100 years. Proper maintenance and Ohio\'s weather conditions also play significant roles in determining your roof\'s actual lifespan.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How often should I have my roof inspected?',
          answer: 'We recommend professional roof inspections at least once per year, ideally in the spring or fall. Additionally, you should schedule an inspection after any severe weather event such as hailstorms, high winds, or heavy snowfall. Regular inspections help identify minor issues before they become costly repairs.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What are the signs that I need a new roof?',
          answer: 'Common warning signs include missing or curling shingles, granule loss in gutters, water stains on ceilings or walls, sagging roof deck, visible light through the roof boards, and a roof age exceeding 20-25 years. If you notice multiple signs, it\'s time to schedule a professional inspection to assess whether repair or replacement is needed.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Are you licensed and insured?',
          answer: 'Yes, DTE Roofing LLC is fully licensed, bonded, and insured in Ohio. We carry comprehensive general liability insurance and workers\' compensation coverage to protect both our team and your property. We\'re happy to provide proof of insurance and our license information upon request.'

      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'How long does a roof replacement take?',
          answer: 'Most residential roof replacements take 1-3 days depending on the size and complexity of your roof, weather conditions, and the type of material being installed. Larger homes or complex roof designs may take longer. Commercial projects vary based on building size and can take several days to weeks. We provide a detailed timeline during your consultation.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What happens during a free estimate?',
          answer: 'During your free estimate, one of our experienced roofing professionals will thoroughly inspect your roof, take measurements and detailed photos, discuss your needs and preferences, answer all your questions, and provide material options. You\'ll receive a comprehensive written estimate with transparent pricing and no obligation. We never pressure customers into making immediate decisions.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What should I expect during installation?',
          answer: 'During installation, our crew will arrive early, protect your property and landscaping, set up safety equipment, and begin work efficiently. You can expect noise and vibration throughout the day. We maintain a clean and organized job site, communicate regularly about progress, and perform thorough cleanup each day including using magnetic tools to collect nails.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How do you handle weather delays?',
          answer: 'Safety and quality are our priorities. If weather conditions aren\'t suitable for roofing work, we\'ll reschedule to ensure proper installation. We monitor forecasts closely and communicate any necessary schedule changes immediately. Your roof will be properly protected if we must stop work due to weather. We work diligently to minimize delays while never compromising quality or safety.'

      faqs: [
        {
          question: 'How much does a new roof cost?',
          answer: 'Roof replacement costs vary widely based on roof size, pitch, complexity, material choice, and extent of any underlying repairs needed. On average, residential roof replacements in Columbus range from $8,000 to $25,000 or more. We provide free, detailed estimates with transparent pricing and no hidden fees so you know exactly what to expect.'

        },
