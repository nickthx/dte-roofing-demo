              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We're based in Columbus at 615 Hilliard Rome Rd, Columbus, OH 43228, and serve Upper Arlington regularly—typically 15-25 minutes depending on traffic and route. From the historic charm of South of Lane neighborhoods to North of Lane's established homes, from the <strong>Lane Avenue corridor</strong> to <strong>Kingsdale</strong> and <strong>Tremont Center</strong> areas, we understand Upper Arlington's distinctive community character and elevated standards. Our owners personally speak with every customer—no sales teams, no runaround—just direct communication and genuine care for your home.

              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Founded in 1918 and fully developed by the 1960s, Upper Arlington features remarkable architectural diversity—from Tudor Revival and Colonial Revival homes in older sections dating to the 1920s-30s, to mid-century modern gems from the 1950s-60s, to transitional styles throughout. This architectural heritage demands roofing expertise that respects historical character while incorporating modern performance and efficiency. The community's mature tree canopy, while enhancing aesthetics and property values, creates specific roofing challenges: debris accumulation, moss growth from shade, and occasional branch damage.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Common roofing challenges in Upper Arlington include: older housing stock with complex rooflines and original flashing that may need updating, mature trees causing constant debris accumulation and gutter issues, strong community standards requiring careful attention to aesthetics and material matching, and scheduling sensitivity around school zones and commute windows. We work efficiently, respect your property, and understand that Upper Arlington homeowners expect professional service that matches the community's reputation.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Upper Arlington's renowned tree canopy creates constant debris accumulation in gutters and valleys. Towering oaks, maples, and sycamores deposit leaves, twigs, and seed pods that trap moisture against shingles and accelerate deterioration. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia and soffit. We address these challenges through regular maintenance, gutter cleaning, and algae-resistant shingles that resist moss growth common in shaded areas.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Many Upper Arlington homes feature complex architecture with dormers, valleys, steep pitches, and decorative details. Older homes often have original flashing around chimneys and skylights that has lost its seal over decades of exposure. Wind-driven rain tests these vulnerable areas during storms. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials designed to last.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Central Ohio's weather patterns bring frequent storms with wind-driven rain that penetrates compromised flashing and seals. Older homes in Upper Arlington—many dating from the 1920s-1960s—require thorough documentation after storms for insurance claims. We provide detailed photo evidence, shingle samples showing hail impact, and written reports that help homeowners file successful claims. As insurers tighten requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-charcoal-900 mb-3">Ventilation and Ice Dam Prevention</h3>
                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Ohio winters bring freeze-thaw cycles that stress roofing systems, especially in older homes with inadequate attic ventilation. Poor ventilation causes warm air to melt snow unevenly, leading to ice dams at eaves and water backup under shingles. We assess ventilation during every inspection, install ice and water shield at vulnerable areas during replacements, and recommend ventilation improvements when needed to prevent winter damage and improve energy efficiency.

                  Upper Arlington homes often feature premium landscaping that requires careful protection. We use tarps to protect plantings, position dumpsters on driveways with protective boards underneath, and conduct thorough cleanup with magnetic rollers to collect nails and debris. We make multiple passes across your driveway, walkways, and yard before we leave. Clean job sites and property protection are part of our detail-first approach—you shouldn't have to worry about damage to your landscaping or nails in your driveway.

                  Yes. Some Upper Arlington neighborhoods have HOA requirements or architectural review processes for exterior work. We're experienced in matching existing shingle styles and colors, providing documentation for HOA submissions, and ensuring work meets community guidelines. We can help you understand what approvals may be needed and provide the information your HOA requires. Our goal is to make the process smooth while respecting Upper Arlington's community standards.

                  Flashing around chimneys, skylights, and dormers (step flashing) is designed to direct water away from these vulnerable intersections. Over time, flashing seals degrade from weather exposure—especially wind-driven rain common in Central Ohio. Many older Upper Arlington homes have original flashing from decades ago that has lost its seal. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials that provide decades of protection.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Absolutely. Ice and water shield is a self-sealing underlayment installed at vulnerable areas like eaves, valleys, and around penetrations. Ohio winters bring freeze-thaw cycles that can cause ice dams, especially on north-facing slopes or homes with inadequate ventilation. Ice and water shield provides critical protection against water backup under shingles. We recommend it for all roof replacements in this climate—it's an affordable upgrade that prevents expensive water damage and gives homeowners peace of mind during harsh winters.

                  Yes. If your roof damage is from wind, hail, or storm events, your homeowner's insurance may cover repairs or replacement. We document storm damage with detailed photos, shingle samples showing hail impact, measurements, and written reports that meet insurance requirements. We can meet with adjusters on-site if needed and explain the claims process. With insurers tightening claim requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important. We work with all major insurance companies and help make the process as smooth as possible.

We prioritize emergency calls and often respond same-day for active leaks. Emergency tarping prevents additional water intrusion while permanent repairs are scheduled, protecting your home's interior and valuable belongings from further damage.

                  Yes. Upper Arlington's mature tree canopy means constant debris accumulation in gutters. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia, soffit, and foundation drainage. We provide gutter cleaning, repairs, and full gutter replacement. We can also install gutter guards in areas with heavy leaf accumulation. If tree debris has caused damage to your fascia or soffit, we assess and repair all related issues comprehensively.
