              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We're based in Columbus at 615 Hilliard Rome Rd, Columbus, OH 43228, and serve Gahanna regularly on the northeast side of Columbus. From the vibrant <strong>Creekside District</strong> (home to Creekside Park and community events) to historic <strong>Old Gahanna</strong>, from neighborhoods near <strong>John Glenn Columbus International Airport</strong> to established areas along <strong>Big Walnut Creek</strong>, we understand Gahanna's "Herb Capital of Ohio" community character. Our owners personally speak with every customer—no sales teams, no runaround—just direct communication and genuine care for your home.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Gahanna features a diverse housing mix—from historic homes in Old Gahanna dating back decades, to mature 1970s-1980s subdivisions, to newer developments. This architectural diversity creates specific roofing challenges: wind-driven rain testing older flashing, mature tree debris clogging gutters, hail and thunderstorm damage common to Central Ohio, and freeze-thaw cycles requiring proper ventilation to prevent ice dams. We've worked throughout Gahanna's neighborhoods and understand what it takes to protect homes in this climate.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We're sensitive to Gahanna's community calendar—we know weeks like <strong>Creekside Blues & Jazz Festival</strong> and <strong>Herb Day</strong> bring high traffic, and we schedule around those peak times when possible. Our detail-first approach means thorough cleanup, property protection, and meticulous craftsmanship on every project. Whether you need emergency storm repairs or a planned roof replacement, we treat your home with the same care we'd expect for our own.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Central Ohio's weather patterns bring frequent wind-driven rain that tests roof seals, especially around chimneys, skylights, and dormers. Older flashing around these vulnerable areas degrades over time, and wind forces water under compromised seals. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials designed for decades of protection against Gahanna's variable weather conditions.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Gahanna experiences frequent hail and severe thunderstorms as part of Central Ohio's weather patterns. After storm events, older roofs require thorough documentation for successful insurance claims. We provide detailed photo evidence, shingle samples showing hail impact, measurements, and written reports that meet insurance requirements. As insurers tighten claim requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important for protecting your investment.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Many established Gahanna neighborhoods feature mature trees that drop constant debris into gutters. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia, soffit, and foundation drainage. Dense shade also encourages moss and algae growth on north-facing slopes. We address these challenges through algae-resistant shingles, gutter maintenance and cleaning, gutter guard installation in high-debris areas, and regular preventative maintenance programs.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Ohio winters bring harsh freeze-thaw cycles that stress roofing systems. Poor attic ventilation—common in older homes—causes warm air to melt snow unevenly, leading to ice dams at eaves and water backup under shingles. We assess ventilation during every inspection, install ice and water shield at vulnerable areas during replacements, and recommend ventilation improvements when needed to prevent winter damage and improve energy efficiency year-round.

                  We prioritize emergency calls and storm damage inspections. For active leaks or visible damage, we often respond same-day or next-day. After major storm events affecting Gahanna, we work through our queue as quickly as possible—typically within 2-3 days. Call 614-971-6028 immediately after storms, and we'll schedule you as soon as possible to document damage for insurance claims.

                  Yes. If your roof damage is from wind, hail, or storm events, your homeowner's insurance may cover repairs or replacement. We document storm damage with detailed photos, shingle samples showing hail impact, measurements, and written reports that meet insurance requirements. We can meet with adjusters on-site if needed and explain the claims process. With insurers tightening claim requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important.

                  Flashing around chimneys, skylights, and dormers (step flashing) is designed to direct water away from these vulnerable intersections. Over time, flashing seals degrade from weather exposure—especially wind-driven rain common in Central Ohio. Wind forces water under compromised seals, leading to leaks that damage interior ceilings and walls. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials that provide decades of protection.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Absolutely. Ice and water shield is a self-sealing underlayment installed at vulnerable areas like eaves, valleys, and around penetrations. Ohio winters bring harsh freeze-thaw cycles that can cause ice dams when poor ventilation allows uneven snow melting. Ice and water shield provides critical protection against water backup under shingles. We recommend it for all roof replacements in this climate—it's an affordable upgrade that prevents expensive water damage.

                  Yes. Mature trees in many Gahanna neighborhoods mean constant debris accumulation in gutters. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia, soffit, and foundation drainage. We provide gutter cleaning, repairs, and full gutter replacement. We can also install gutter guards in areas with heavy leaf accumulation. If tree debris has caused damage to your fascia or soffit, we assess and repair all related issues comprehensively.

                  Yes. Some Gahanna neighborhoods have HOA requirements or architectural guidelines for exterior work. We're experienced in matching existing shingle styles and colors, providing documentation for HOA submissions where needed, and ensuring work meets community standards. We can help you understand what approvals may be required and provide the information necessary. Our goal is to make the process smooth while respecting Gahanna's community character.
