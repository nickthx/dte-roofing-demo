              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                DTE Roofing is not just another contractor serving Hilliard—we are from here. Founders Donovan and Mitchell grew up in Hilliard and graduated from Hilliard Davidson High School. Our office at 615 Hilliard Rome Rd (Columbus mailing address, just off the west side) means we are minutes from anywhere in town, whether you are in Old Hilliard near the historic downtown and Center Street Market, the established neighborhoods off Cemetery Road, or the newer developments along Cosgray Road and Scioto Reserve.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Hilliard has grown tremendously over the years, transforming from a small town of a few thousand into one of Central Ohio's most desirable communities with a population of about 38,832 (2024 estimate). This growth means diverse housing stock with different roofing needs: historic homes in Old Hilliard requiring careful preservation approaches, 1980s-90s builds in neighborhoods like Hilliard Estates and Britton Farms now reaching the age where original roofs need replacement, and newer construction in areas like Scioto Reserve and Crossing at Scioto where builder-grade materials may already be showing wear.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We understand Hilliard's specific challenges: the wind exposure from open farmland to the west that drives wind-driven rain against flashing and seals, the mature tree canopy in older neighborhoods causing debris accumulation and shade-related moss growth, and the strict HOA requirements in many subdivisions. Hilliard's winters also bring freeze-thaw cycles that stress poor ventilation systems, and locals know parking gets tight around Station Park and during Freedom Fest at Roger A. Reynolds Municipal Park—we plan service schedules around community events to minimize disruption. As locals, we know the permitting process with the City of Hilliard and can navigate it efficiently for you.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Hilliard's western exposure to open farmland means storms arrive with full force. Wind-driven rain tests flashing around chimneys, skylights, and step flashing along dormers. Older homes in Old Hilliard and established neighborhoods often have original flashing that has lost its seal, leading to leaks during heavy rains. We inspect and repair these vulnerable areas with great attention to detail.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Ohio winters create freeze-thaw cycles that stress roofing systems, especially in older homes with inadequate attic ventilation. Poor ventilation causes warm air to melt snow unevenly, leading to ice dams at eaves and water backup under shingles. We assess ventilation during every inspection and recommend improvements when needed to prevent winter damage.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Hilliard's mature tree canopy is beautiful but causes constant debris accumulation in gutters, especially in neighborhoods like Britton Farms and Hilliard Estates. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia and soffit. Overhanging branches also scrape shingles and trap moisture, leading to premature wear and moss growth. We handle both gutter cleaning and roof repairs caused by tree-related issues.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Many homes in Hilliard Estates, Britton Farms, and similar 1980s-90s developments have original roofs now 30-40 years old. These roofs are past their expected lifespan and often show curling shingles, granule loss, and compromised flashing. We help homeowners determine whether repairs can extend roof life or if replacement is the smarter investment.

                  Yes. We're locals who know that parking around Station Park and Old Hilliard gets tight during Center Street Market weekends, and that Freedom Fest at Roger A. Reynolds Municipal Park draws big crowds. We plan service schedules to work around community events and minimize disruption to your neighborhood. Just let us know your timing preferences when you call.

                  Yes, we're experienced with HOA requirements in Hilliard neighborhoods. Many subdivisions have specific rules about shingle colors, architectural styles, and approval processes. We help you understand what approvals are needed and can provide documentation to your HOA board. We've worked successfully with HOAs throughout Heritage Lakes, Crossing at Scioto, Hayden Run, and other communities.

                  <span>What causes leaks around chimneys and step flashing in older homes?</span>
                  <span className="text-primary-700 group-open:rotate-180 transition-transform">▼</span>

                <p className="text-charcoal-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Flashing around chimneys, skylights, and along dormers (step flashing) is meant to direct water away from these vulnerable intersections. Over time, flashing seals degrade from weather exposure, especially with wind-driven rain common in Hilliard. Older homes in Old Hilliard and neighborhoods like Britton Farms often have original flashing that has lost its seal. We inspect flashing carefully during every roof assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials that last.

                  <span>Is ice and water shield worth it here in Hilliard?</span>

                <p className="text-charcoal-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Absolutely. Ice and water shield is a self-sealing underlayment installed at vulnerable areas like eaves, valleys, and around penetrations. Ohio winters bring freeze-thaw cycles that can cause ice dams, especially on north-facing slopes. Ice and water shield provides extra protection against water backup under shingles. We recommend it for all roof replacements in this climate—it's an affordable upgrade that prevents expensive water damage.

                  We prioritize storm response for Hilliard customers. After major storms, we typically respond within 24-48 hours. If there's active leaking or emergency damage, we can often come same-day for temporary repairs or tarping. Once on-site, one of our owners inspects your roof thoroughly, documents any storm damage with photos for insurance purposes, and explains your options clearly. Call 614-971-6028 as soon as you suspect storm damage.

                  Yes. Hilliard's mature tree canopy is beautiful but causes constant debris in gutters. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia, soffit, and even foundation drainage. We provide gutter cleaning, repairs, and full gutter replacement. We can also install gutter guards in areas with heavy leaf accumulation. If tree debris has caused damage to your roof or gutters, we assess and repair all related issues in one visit.

                  We take cleanup seriously. During tear-off, we use tarps and magnetic sweepers to catch nails and debris. After the job, we make multiple passes with rolling magnets across your driveway, walkways, and yard. We inspect the entire property before we leave. Clean jobsites are part of our detail-first approach—you shouldn't have to worry about nails in your tires or your kids' feet.

                  Yes. If your roof damage is from wind, hail, or storm events, your homeowner's insurance may cover repairs or replacement. We document storm damage with detailed photos and measurements, meet with adjusters on-site if needed, and provide written estimates that match insurance requirements. We explain the claims process and help you understand your policy coverage. We work with all major insurance companies and make the process as smooth as possible.
