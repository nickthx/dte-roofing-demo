              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                We're based in Columbus at 615 Hilliard Rome Rd, Columbus, OH 43228, and serve Westerville regularly—typically 15-30 minutes depending on traffic and route. From historic <strong>Uptown Westerville</strong> and <strong>State Street's</strong> vibrant corridor to established neighborhoods near <strong>Otterbein University</strong>, from <strong>Hoover Reservoir</strong> areas to <strong>Blendon Woods</strong> edges, we understand Westerville's community character and diverse housing stock. Our owners personally speak with every customer—no sales teams, no runaround—just direct communication and genuine care for your home.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Founded in 1858, Westerville features remarkable architectural diversity—from Victorian-era homes in Uptown dating to the late 1800s, to mid-century ranches and colonials from the 1960s-70s, to newer subdivisions throughout. This mix of older housing stock with complex rooflines and mature trees creates specific roofing challenges: original flashing that may need updating, constant debris accumulation requiring gutter maintenance, moss growth from shade, and aging roofs from 1970s-1990s development cycles now reaching replacement age.
              </p>
              <p className="text-lg text-charcoal-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                Common roofing challenges in Westerville include: mature trees causing debris and gutter clogs, older homes with chimney and step flashing leaks, wind-driven rain testing seals during storms, ventilation issues leading to ice dams in winter, and community standards requiring quality materials and careful aesthetics. We work efficiently, respect your property, and understand that Westerville homeowners expect professional service with minimal disruption around school zones and commute windows.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Westerville's established neighborhoods feature magnificent mature oaks, maples, and ash trees that define the community's character but create constant roofing challenges. Heavy leaf accumulation clogs gutters causing overflow that damages fascia and soffit. Dense shade encourages moss and algae growth on north-facing slopes. Overhanging branches scrape protective granules from shingles and occasionally drop during storms causing punctures. We address these challenges through algae-resistant shingles, gutter maintenance, and regular debris removal.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Many Westerville homes—especially in Uptown and 1960s-70s neighborhoods—feature complex rooflines with chimneys, dormers, and valleys. Original flashing around these vulnerable areas degrades over decades of exposure to weather. Wind-driven rain tests compromised seals during storms, leading to leaks that damage interior ceilings and walls. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials designed for decades of protection.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Central Ohio's weather patterns bring frequent storms with wind-driven rain, hail, and occasional severe events. Older roofs in Westerville neighborhoods require thorough documentation after storms for successful insurance claims. We provide detailed photo evidence, shingle samples showing hail impact, measurements, and written reports that meet insurance requirements. As insurers tighten claim requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important for protecting your investment.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600">
                  Ohio winters bring harsh freeze-thaw cycles that stress roofing systems. Poor attic ventilation—common in older Westerville homes—causes warm air to melt snow unevenly, leading to ice dams at eaves and water backup under shingles. We assess ventilation during every inspection, install ice and water shield at vulnerable areas during replacements, and recommend ventilation improvements when needed to prevent winter damage and improve energy efficiency.

                  We use tarps to protect landscaping, position dumpsters on driveways with protective boards underneath, and conduct thorough cleanup with magnetic rollers to collect nails and debris. We make multiple passes across your driveway, walkways, and yard before we leave. Clean job sites and property protection are part of our detail-first approach—you shouldn't have to worry about damage to your landscaping or nails in your driveway after we're done.

                  Yes. Some Westerville neighborhoods have HOA requirements or architectural guidelines for exterior work. We're experienced in matching existing shingle styles and colors, providing documentation for HOA submissions where needed, and ensuring work meets community standards. We can help you understand what approvals may be required and provide the information necessary. Our goal is to make the process smooth while respecting Westerville's community character.

                  Flashing around chimneys, skylights, and dormers (step flashing) is designed to direct water away from these vulnerable intersections. Over time, flashing seals degrade from weather exposure—especially wind-driven rain common in Central Ohio. Many older Westerville homes have original flashing from decades ago that has lost its seal. We inspect flashing carefully during every assessment and repair or replace it with high-quality materials that provide decades of protection.

                <p className="text-charcoal-600 mt-4 leading-relaxed">
                  Absolutely. Ice and water shield is a self-sealing underlayment installed at vulnerable areas like eaves, valleys, and around penetrations. Ohio winters bring harsh freeze-thaw cycles that can cause ice dams, especially on north-facing slopes or homes with inadequate ventilation. Ice and water shield provides critical protection against water backup under shingles. We recommend it for all roof replacements in this climate—it's an affordable upgrade that prevents expensive water damage.

                  Yes. If your roof damage is from wind, hail, or storm events, your homeowner's insurance may cover repairs or replacement. We document storm damage with detailed photos, shingle samples showing hail impact, measurements, and written reports that meet insurance requirements. We can meet with adjusters on-site if needed and explain the claims process. With insurers tightening claim requirements in 2025-2026, proper documentation has never been more important. We work with all major insurance companies.

We prioritize emergency calls and often respond same-day for active leaks. Emergency tarping prevents additional water intrusion while permanent repairs are scheduled, protecting your home's interior and valuable belongings from further damage.

                  Yes. Westerville's mature tree canopy means constant debris accumulation in gutters. Clogged gutters overflow during rains, damaging fascia, soffit, and foundation drainage. We provide gutter cleaning, repairs, and full gutter replacement. We can also install gutter guards in areas with heavy leaf accumulation. If tree debris has caused damage to your fascia or soffit, we assess and repair all related issues comprehensively.
