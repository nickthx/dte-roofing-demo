## Content Additions

### 1. Commercial Roofing Systems for Central Ohio Businesses (~1,400 words)

**Replaced:** Brief system cards with basic features
**Added:** Five comprehensive sections with detailed Central Ohio climate analysis

#### TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin) Roofing (Detailed Section)
**Advantages for Columbus Businesses:**
- Reflective white surface reduces cooling costs during hot Ohio summers
- Heat-welded seams remain secure through freeze-thaw cycles
- Excellent resistance to UV radiation, ozone, and chemical exposure
- Remains flexible in cold weather without cracking
- Competitive pricing with 15-30 year lifespan

**Considerations:**
- Requires skilled installation for proper seam welding
- Can be punctured by sharp objects or heavy foot traffic
- White surface shows dirt more readily than darker membranes

**Best For:** Office buildings, retail centers, warehouses prioritizing energy efficiency and long-term value

#### EPDM (Rubber) Roofing (Detailed Section)
**Advantages for Columbus Businesses:**
- Outstanding weather resistance handles Ohio's temperature fluctuations
- Proven track record with 20-30+ year lifespan
- Lower initial cost compared to TPO and metal systems
- Simple repairs minimize business disruption
- Available in black (standard) or white (energy efficient)

**Considerations:**
- Black EPDM absorbs heat, increasing summer cooling costs
- Seams are glued rather than welded, requiring careful installation
- Can shrink slightly over time with temperature changes

**Best For:** Industrial facilities, warehouses, and budget-conscious property owners seeking reliable performance

#### Modified Bitumen Roofing (Detailed Section)
**Advantages for Columbus Businesses:**
- Multi-layer construction provides excellent protection
- Self-healing properties seal minor punctures automatically
- Withstands foot traffic from HVAC maintenance
- Flexible in cold Ohio winters without brittleness
- Multiple installation methods suit various project needs

**Considerations:**
- Torch-applied installation requires experienced contractors
- Heavier than single-ply membranes
- Dark surfaces absorb heat unless topped with reflective coating

**Best For:** Restaurants, retail buildings with rooftop HVAC, properties requiring durable high-traffic surfaces

#### Metal Roofing Systems (Detailed Section)
**Advantages for Columbus Businesses:**
- Exceptional lifespan (40-70 years) maximizes investment
- Sheds snow and ice efficiently, reducing load concerns
- Fire resistant—important for insurance and safety
- Reflective coatings reduce cooling costs significantly
- Minimal maintenance requirements save long-term costs
- Sustainable—typically contains 25-95% recycled content

**Considerations:**
- Higher upfront investment than membrane systems
- Requires specialized installation expertise
- Can be noisy during heavy rain or hail (less issue for commercial)

**Best For:** Office buildings, warehouses, manufacturing facilities prioritizing longevity and sustainability

#### Built-Up Roofing (BUR) (Detailed Section)
**Advantages for Columbus Businesses:**
- Multiple layers provide redundant waterproofing protection
- Proven performance track record in Ohio climate
- Seamless installation eliminates weak points
- Cost-effective for larger commercial buildings
- Gravel top layer provides UV and impact protection

**Considerations:**
- Heavy system requires adequate structural support
- Installation odors may affect adjacent businesses temporarily
- Gravel complicates leak detection and some repairs

**Best For:** Large warehouses, industrial facilities, properties with adequate structural capacity

**Service Integration:** Natural link to roof inspection services for system assessments
